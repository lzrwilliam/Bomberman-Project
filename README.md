# Bomberman

**Game description**
<br><br>
This project simulates the popular game known as Bomberman by using an 8x8 LED Matrix on Arduino platform. The purpose of the game is to destroy as much as possible objects by placing a bomb as close as possible to the objects. Playing the game becomes harder with each level that the player is advancing, by making the bombs the explode faster, the objects movements are more frequently and also the time to destroy everything is less than the precedent level. 
The map with walls and objects are randomly generated every time, no matter if it is a new level or if the game has started from beginning, and the player is spawned randomly as well.
